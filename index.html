  <h1>Home </h1>
  <p>Hello everybody and welcome to my online portfolio assignment. In here I have a few different tabs here that highlight some of my achievements, education, and just about me in general. My about page consists of who I am as a person and I share my interests and aspirations. The Portfolio tab will explain some of the things that I have accomplished while in college working towards a Degree in multi-media journalism. My contact page will outline the best ways to contact me about any of my projects. Finally, I have an education page that will describe all of the accomplishments I have completed through various educations.</p>
<p>This is the first website that I have designed myself, and I am excited to share my progress with all of you. I am stepping out of my usual comfort zone with a project like this because as I just stated I have never designed a website from scratch like this before. I usually partake in projects that revolve around writing or taking photographs, and then I use a site that has all of the features easily accessible opposed to just making my own. </p>
<p>I made this website with the Adobe application Dreamweaver and it took me some time to complete. I tried to incorporate as many of the things I learned, though this is probably the hardest course I have ever taken at the University of New Mexico. I definitely have a brain that works differently than coding, but I had a fun time learning everything that I could.

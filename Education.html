<h1>Education</h1>
<p>My educational journey has been rather traditional. I attended the same schooling system for all of grade school in the town I grew up in, and by the time middle school rolled around, I attended that system all the way through high school. I graduated high school in 2020 which was admittedly very nontraditional with the pandemic taking place right in the middle of my senior year. I ultimately graduated regardless of the weird year of schooling and then moved from New Jersey to Albuquerque, New Mexico to start college.  </p>
<p>2020 was a strange year to start college in the same way as finishing high school. I was 2,000 miles away from home and knew nobody. I initially went into college with the expectation of being a business major. But, amidst sitting in my room all day I found a passion for writing and became a multi-media journalism major. I have been doing that since my second semester and have not looked back since. I am in a position where I will be graduating next semester in the spring of 2024. During my time as a college student, I have participated in many journalism-based events. i have published multiple stories on the New Mexico News Port and was given the opportunity to attend the republican race watch party as the press. These experiences have given me lots of experience in the field and have helped shape my writing into what it is now. </p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>

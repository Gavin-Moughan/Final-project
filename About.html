  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>On this page, I want to let you all know a little bit more about me. As you already know my name is Gavin Moughan. I am currently living in New Mexico, and attending the University of New Mexico, but more on that on the Education page. I am initially from New Jersey about twenty minutes from the city of Philadelphia. I am a huge fan of all of their sports teams. I support the Flyers, Eagles, Sixers, and Phillies listed in order of my favorite to least favorite. I also love reality television, primarily the show Survivor on CBS.</p>
<p>In my future, I am not 100% certain what I want to do in my future, but I do know I want to write in some capacity. In an ideal world, I would be an author for novels that I get to write whatever I would like, but I know that is not realistic. I have many ideas for books and I have been trying for a while to put pen to paper and make a thorough story with all of my scattered ideas, and it would be great to turn those fun ideas into a successful career. </p>
<p>I enjoyed the blog assignment for our class especially because it helped me feel like a real writer already. I wrote about the Eagles on a semi-weekly basis, and I had a great time doing that. I love football, and being able to write my opinions for the world to see is a dream come true as well. </p>

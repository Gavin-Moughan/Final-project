  <h1>Portfolio</h1>
  <p>Here is my writing portfolio with a few of my favorite blog posts. These will all pertain to the Philadelphia Eagles. I have written posts about every game thus far for the 2023 season. As you can probably tell through my site colors, or my previous pages, I am an avid Philadelphia sports fan and this blog has been a great way of expressing what I love. </p>
  <p>I have also attached some of my articles that have been published, and specifically ones that I think worked really well as I still try to find my specific style of writing. My first attached article is about the Festival of the Cranes that takes place yearly in New Mexico. The second attached article is based on the legalization of marijuana in New Mexico, which I co-wrote. I figured it would be a good idea to share my collaborative work as well.  </p>
  <p>If you want to get excited about the eagles check out my blog from week 11 or week 12 where I start to get pretty excited to see what they are doing this season. Inversley if you want to be mad at the recent performance of teh Eagles, check out my Weeks 13 &amp; 14 blog where I air out my frustrations with their most recent two loses. I hope you find something that I have written that you personally enjoy, and maybe we can collaborate t some point in the future if you feel we have similar interests or styles. Enjoy!</p>
